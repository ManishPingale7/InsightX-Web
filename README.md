# Predictive Maintenance Project

## Overview

The Predictive Maintenance Project aims to enhance industrial machinery efficiency by predicting potential failures before they occur. The predictive maintenance prototype was developed using synthesized data, while real data from an induction motor was employed for condition monitoring. This project utilizes Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to analyze machinery conditions, reducing unplanned downtime and maintenance costs. A mobile app and a web dashboard provide real-time monitoring and user interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python, JS, Kotlin (for mobile app)
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for web dashboard)
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Database**: MySQL,Room

## Data Source

The project utilizes data sourced from a research paper, which includes historical and real-time datasets relevant to machinery condition monitoring.
